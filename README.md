# Gibbs sampling in NetLogo

This repository contains a NetLogo model of a Gibbs sampler based on the one I found implemented in matlab: https://theclevermachine.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/mcmc-the-gibbs-sampler/ .
The second source I used here: http://users.aims.ac.za/~ioana/cp4.pdf .

I created the model in an attempt to get a better understanding of how Gibbs sampling worked when I started to learn about Boltzmann machines. 

If you have any comments, if you think anything is wrong with the model, or have any suggestions to improve it, feel free to send me an e-mail.
